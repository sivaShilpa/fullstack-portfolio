    "bio": "I am a lifelong learner and a software developer, with a creative and solution-driven mind having a passion to learn anything I want quickly and skillfully. I have spent a lot of time, while being a full time stay at home mom, in learning arts and crafts such as decorating cakes, knitting, crocheting, sewing and beading on my own. I am a detail-oriented problem solver with great organizational and adaptability skills. I am passionate about coding as it gives me opportunities to grow these skills even further in a challenging technical world."
